# bruit.parquet

## source: AMP métropole, calculation by X. Timbeau

## CRS: 3035/geoparquet

data is from AMP métropole open data (https://data.ampmetropole.fr/explore/dataset/bruit-routier-type-a-lden-sur-24h-etude-de-bruit-impedance-ingenierie/information/) and results from a modelisation of road noise. It is then rasterized and projected on a 200m INSPIRE grid. The rasterization implies some approximations.

isophone: the noise level (dB, the higher, the noisier)
