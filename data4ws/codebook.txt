data is from AMP métropole open data (https://data.ampmetropole.fr/explore/dataset/bruit-routier-type-a-lden-sur-24h-etude-de-bruit-impedance-ingenierie/information/) and results from a modelisation of road noise. It is then rasterized and projected on a 200m INSPIRE grid. The rasterization implies some approximations.

## source: Fichiers Fonciers, caclulation by M. Parodi and X. Timbeau

## CRS: 3035/parquet and 4326/geojson

Data on shops (in a broad sense), from Fichiers Fonciers. This is quite exhaustive as it is collected and used by the tax administation. However, some data may be inacurate and does not fit perfectly with other sources. A shop is a commercial activity in a selection of sectors. 4 main categories have been chosen: food (alim), non food shops (comm), human health (sante, ie doctors, nurses, dentist, kine, pharmacy (no hospital)), leasure (sortie, ie. movie theaters, theaters, bars, disco, restaurants).

idINS: the INSPIRE id
sprincp: surface of the venue (as recorded in the FF)
cconac: code NAF of the activity (end user), code NAF explantion can be found there : https://doc-datafoncier.cerema.fr/doc/ff/pb0010_local/cconactxt
type: large categories (4 kind)

## CRS: 3035/parquet and 4326/geojson

Extraction of some data from OSM. Main shops brands have been selected, leading to 417 shop in the ASM métropole perimeter.
More data can be extracted by modifying the provided R code (make data4ws.R, section commerces from osm).

idINS: the INSPIRE id
osm_id: the OSM id (not very useful)
name: name of the shop
brand: brand of the shop (usually the same as the name)

Extraction of some data from BPE. Schools (from maternelle to lycée, excluding professional schools) are all geolocalized, plus a indicator of capacity (number of seats).
More data can be extracted from BPE by modifying the provided R code (make data4ws.R, section ecoles).

idINS: the INSPIRE id
SDOM: main catagory
TYPEQU: category of equipment (detailled)
NOMRS: name of the equipment (here name of the school), may be used to identify public and private schools

# walk.parquet

## source: distance calculation by M. Parodi and X. Timbeau, using OSM, GTFS from AMP, and various routing software (R5, dodgr).

Distance and travel time between pairs of idINS walking and following the street network. The shortest path is chosen between each pair, minimizing a Tobler like cost function, i.e. avoiding when possible to climb.
Time travel less than 1 hour only. Attention the file is quite large (10,110,257 pairs, 236Mb in memory). The relation is symetric as no restrictions apply to walking (path from-to is the same length/time as to-from)

fromidINS: the origin point on the INSPIRE grid
toidINS: the destination point on the INSPIRE grid
tt: the travel time from fromidINS to toidINS, in second, as an integer to save place
d: the travel distance from fromidINS to toidINS, in meter, as an integer to save place

# bike.parquet

## source: distance calculation by M. Parodi and X. Timbeau, using OSM, GTFS from AMP, and various routing software (R5, dodgr).

Distance and travel time between pairs of idINS biking and following the street network. The shortest path is chosen between each pair, minimizing a Tobler like cost function, i.e. avoiding when possible to climb.
Time travel less than 1 hour only. Attention the file is quite large (20,083,689 pairs, 237Mb in memory). The relation is symetric as no restrictions apply to biking (path from-to is the same length/time as to-from). There are more pairs for biking than for walking as the average speed of a biker (12km/h) is higher than a walker (5km/h) (and the relation is not linear, but quadratic).

fromidINS: the origin point on the INSPIRE grid
toidINS: the destination point on the INSPIRE grid
tt: the travel time from fromidINS to toidINS, in second, as an integer to save place
d: the travel distance from fromidINS to toidINS, in meter, as an integer to save place

# transit.parquet

## source: distance calculation by M. Parodi and X. Timbeau, using OSM, GTFS from AMP, and various routing software (R5, dodgr).

Distance and travel time between pairs of idINS walking and using the transit system (tram, bus, metro, train, boats, funiculaire or téléphérique). The journey is taken between 8 and 9am on a normal week day and the best travel time is chosen in this 1 hour time window. This matters because of multiple ride journey and matching frequencies and waiting time at each station. Timetable are announced time table and may differ from reality.
No distance is calculated, only time travel less than 1 hour are kept. Attention the file is quite large (49,481,589 pairs, 950Mb in memory). The relation is symetric as no restrictions apply to biking (path from-to is the same length/time as to-from)

fromidINS: the origin point on the INSPIRE grid
toidINS: the destination point on the INSPIRE grid
tt: the travel time from fromidINS to toidINS, in second, as an integer to save place

Distance and travel time between pairs of idINS walking and using the transit system (tram, bus, metro, train, boats, funiculaire or téléphérique). The journey is taken between 8 and 9am on a normal week day and the best travel time is chosen in this 1 hour time window. This matters because of multiple ride journey and matching frequencies and waiting time at each station. Timetable are announced time table and may differ from reality.
Only time travel less than 30 minute are kept. Attention the file is quite large (10,153,564 pairs, 237Mb in memory). The relation is symetric as no restrictions apply to biking (path from-to is the same length/time as to-from)

# distances iris.parquet

## source: distance calculation by M. Parodi and X. Timbeau, using OSM, GTFS from AMP, and various routing software (R5, dodgr). Aggregated by IRIS (instead of idINS)

Distance and travel time between pairs of IRISes for all modes (walk, bike, transit, car). The aggregation is done by using idINS distances and weighing distances in each pairs by population (so an iris where there is only one square will be equivalent to this square). As there is lees data in the end (2,000,310 lines, between. 250k and 600k per mode), there is a larger threshold used. This allows faster and easier calcultations.

fromIRIS: the origin IRIS
toidINS: the destination IRIS
tt: the travel time from fromIRIS to toIRIS, in second, as an integer to save place
d: the distance from fromIRIS to toIRIS, in meter, as an integer to save place
mode: the mode of transport (walk_tblr, bike_tblr, transit, car_dgr)

# prix_immo.parquet

prix_20xx: average price per square meter for the year 20xx in the IRIS
